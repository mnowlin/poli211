# Course Description

> _Our responsibility is one of decision---for to govern is to choose_ 
> - John F. Kennedy

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent As stated by President Kennedy, making choices is at the heart of governing. How do policymakers make choices regarding public policy? This course will address this question by examining the policymaking process in the United States. 

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent Throughout this course we will explore the historical and social context in which policymaking occurs; how problems reach the agendas of policymakers and how policies are formed to address those problems; the adoption of specific policy alternatives; how policies are implemented; and, finally, how public policies are evaluated. 

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent \textbf{Course Catalog}: This course examines the cultural, economic, and institutional contexts that shape U.S. public policy. The course examines the processes by which policy problems are addressed and alternate solutions are adopted. Implications for solving public problems and resolving political disagreements in a manner consistent with democratic ideas are considered.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent This course will be _lecture_ and _discussion_ based. Being able to adequately participate requires you to come to class prepared by having done the assigned readings prior to class. In addition, you should be prepared to participate in class by asking questions and making informed comments that add to the class discussion. **I may call on you to answer a question or discuss your policy issue**. 

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent Laptops are allowed, but discouraged. Phones are only to be used to answer quiz questions.  _I encourage you to take notes by hand, with pen and paper_. [You learn better that way](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/learning/should-teachers-and-professors-ban-student-use-of-laptops-in-class.html). I recommend taking notes using the [Cornell Method](http://www.usu.edu/arc/idea_sheets/pdf/note_taking_cornell.pdf).  Also, lecture slides will generally __not__ be made available outside of class.
