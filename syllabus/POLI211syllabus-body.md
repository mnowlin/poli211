# Course Description

_Our responsibility is one of decision---for to govern is to choose. - John F. Kennedy_

\vspace{0.15in}

\noindent As stated by President Kennedy, making choices is at the heart of governing. How do policymakers make choices regarding public policy? This course will address this question by examining the policymaking process in the United States. 

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent Throughout this course we will explore the historical and social context in which policymaking occurs; how problems reach the agendas of policymakers and how policies are formed to address those problems; the adoption of specific policy alternatives; how policies are implemented; and, finally, how public policies are evaluated. 

## Course Goals and Learning Objectives

The goals for this course are to:

* Understand the public policy process in the US
* Apply various public policy models to real world policy issues
* Analyze the merits of public policy debates
* Analyze the merits of alternative policy solutions to public problems

### General Social Science Education Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course students should be able to apply social science concepts, models or theories to explain human behavior, social interactions or social institutions. This will be assessed in the final exam. 

## Delivery Format

This is an asynchronous online course, and so it is largely self-paced. Students must have access to a __computer__ with __high-speed internet access__ throughout the course. In addition, students must have access to __OAKS__ and _should check OAKS frequently (AT LEAST every other day) to be sure not to fall behind_. Finally, students must have access to their __CofC email__. __Computer failure/unavailability does not constitute an excuse for not completing assignments by the due date__. 

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent It is essential that students stay on top of the course assignments. I will post due dates, but it is your responsibility to make sure you don't get behind, especially in a class this short. Do not make the mistake of thinking this is an easy class because we're meeting online, or an easy class because it's meeting over the summer. The material is quite difficult, and will take a lot of effort on your part to master. _A summer class that meets face-to-face normally entails three hours of classroom time per weekday, plus reading and homework each night. The workload for this class will be the same, except our classroom will be OAKS_.
