Major Health Programs refers to four programs: Medicare (for seniors and disabled people); Medicaid (for low-income people); health insurance subsidies and related programs (for low- and moderate-income people); and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (for low-income children and parents).

Social Security provides payments to retired and disabled workers, as well as to their spouses, dependent children, and survivors.

Income Security Programs make payments to individuals based on their income through programs such as the following: earned income, child, and other tax credits (refundable tax credits for the working poor); the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps); Supplemental Security Income (payments to disabled children and adults with limited incomes); unemployment compensation (time-limited payments for people who become unemployed); family support and foster care; and child nutrition.

Federal Retirement Programs for federal civilian and military retirees.

Veterans’ Programs that provide pensions, income support, and other benefits for those who previously served in the military.

Other Programs consist of a diverse group of activities, including those that provide agricultural subsidies, student loan subsidies, healthcare benefits for retirees of the uniformed services, and deposit insurance.

Social Security and major health programs account for three-quarters of programmatic mandatory spending
