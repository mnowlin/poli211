# The Market 

--

**A market is a _decentralized_ collection of buyers and sellers whose interactions determine the allocation of a good or a set of goods through _exchange_**


--
**Decentralized** 
* The price and quantity of goods are determined by the _interaction of supply and demand_

# Market Assumptions  

--

**Perfect competition** 
* No seller or buyer can independently affect price 

--

**Perfect information** 
* Buyers and sellers know the quality of the good 

--

**Perfectly complete** 
* All relevant costs and benefits are borne by the buyers and sellers

# Market Failures


~~**Perfect competition**~~ 
* Insufficient competition: _Monopoly_

--

~~**Perfect information**~~
* Asymmetric information: _Used cars_

--

~~**Perfectly complete**~~
* Externalities: _Social cost $>$ Private cost_

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

--

## Measure the costs and benefits of each possible policy and then choose the policy that generates the _maximum net benefit_ to society as a whole

--

**Efficiency**: maximizing net benefits

--

**When markets fail they aren't providing the most efficient outcome** 

--

**CBA provides a systematic way to consider _trade-offs_ associated with policy alternatives and select the most efficient alternative**

# Sunstein: Facts not Values 

--

**_If you could show that a certain approach to, let’s say, motor vehicle safety would save 700 lives annually and cost $8,000, it wouldn’t matter what your values are, if you’re sane. That’s a pretty good thing to do_.**

--

**_Suppose you could show that an approach favored by environmental groups would cost $60 billion and only modestly contribute to public health. It would be very hard, even if you’re a very fervent progressive, to think that’s a good idea._**

---

class: title title-1

# Sunstein: Facts not Values 

**Immersion in the facts often makes value disagreements feel much less relevant**  

--

**People often use value cues as a basis for judgment and a mental shortcut. But, once people spend time to think about the costs and benefits, often value disagreement will dissipate** 

--

**_Do you agree with this statement?_** 

--

**It depends**

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

**The major steps** 

--

1. Specify the set of alternatives

--

1. Catalog the costs and benefits and select measurement indicators

--

1. Monetize all costs and benefits

--

1. Discount benefits and costs to obtain _net present values_

--

1. Compute the net present value of each alternative

--

1. Based on net present values determine the most efficient alternative 

---

class: title title-1

# Cost-Benefit Analysis: Example 

**What is the efficient level of sulfur dioxide abatement?**

--

**Efficiency: maximizing net benefits**

* Net Benefits = B(X)-C(X)
* Maximize the _difference_ between benefits and costs 

--

**The economically efficient level of pollution is not zero**

* The gains are not worth the extra cost
* Zero abatement is also inefficient 

---

class: title title-1

# Cost-Benefit Analysis: Example 

**What is the efficient level of sulfur dioxide abatement?**


**Abatement cost function**: Increasing costs at an increasing rate 

--

**Abatement benefit function**: Willingness to pay declines as we get more 

--

**Compare benefits to costs and find where the difference is greatest**

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

**How are costs measured?** 

--

**Opportunity costs** 

--

* What you give up by doing one thing instead of another

--

* The value of the "next best" thing 

--

* Represents the _true_ cost of any activity 

---

class: title title-1 

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

**How are costs measured?** 

**Costs are borne by individuals including taxpayers, shareholders, and consumers** 

--

**Pollution control example**
* Obtaining information from industry 
* Data on revenues and production costs to estimate lost profits

---

class: title title-1

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

**How are benefits measured?** 

--

**Willingness-to-pay**

--

* A way to determine a person's value for a particular good; what they would willingly give up in exchange 

--

* Measures the _maximum_ an individual is willing to pay 

--

* No payments need to be made 

--

**Preference of individuals without judgment of values**  

---

class: title title-1

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Willingness-to-pay**

**Straightforward for consumer goods, more difficult for other types of goods** 
--


**Revealed preference**: Inferred willingness-to-pay 
* Travel-cost method
* Hedonic price method 

---

class: title title-1

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Willingness-to-pay**

**Straightforward for consumer goods, more difficult for other types of goods** 

**Contingent valuation**: A stated preference approach 
* Survey groups of people and ask their willingness-to-pay

---

class: title title-1

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Discounting**

* Efficient policy maximizes the _present value_ of net benefits to society  
* Time value of money
    * Future value vs. present value of $100

# The Value of A Statistical Life

**Example** 

* What would someone be willing to pay for a reduction in their individual risk of dying of 1 in 100,000, or 0.001%, over the next year? 

--

* One fewer death among the 100,000 is "one statistical life saved" 

--

* The average WTP is $100, so $100 x 100,000 

--

* The value of a statistical life = $10 million
