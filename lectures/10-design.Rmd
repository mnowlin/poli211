# Designing Public Policy: Problems 

**How do we know we need a policy?**

--

**Something we can do something about** 

* Is something a problem? Or is it a condition about which we can do little?
* Is there a _market failure_? 

---

class: title title-1

# Designing Public Policy: Problems 

**How do we know we need a policy?**


**We learn about problems through...**
* Changes in indicators of problems
* Sudden, harmful, or frightening focusing events

--

**Problems are not obvious and self-evident** 

* Problem definition is contested
* Problem definition shapes the solutions to problems

--

* What if the causal theory is _wrong_?
* Problems are complex
