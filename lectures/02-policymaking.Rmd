# Policy Stages 

**Strengths and weaknesses of the stages model**  

* Implies a beginning and an end — _the cycle is actually endless_ 
* Implies an orderly step of stages — _stages can be skipped, taken out of order_ 
* Stages can overlap — _implementation and evaluation, for example_ 

**Strength: it’s still a good way to organize our thinking**

# Democracy 

* Public policy is about making choices _collectively_ 

* How do we decide? What is the process?

* One _elementary principle_ of democracy:  

> That all members [of a polity] are to be treated (under the constitution) as if they were equally qualified to participate in the process of making decisions about the policies [the polity] will pursue
