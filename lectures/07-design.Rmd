# Policy Implementation 

> The process by which policies enacted by government are put into effect by the relevant agencies 

--

* Policy design and implementation are not separate

--

* Legislative intent is often unclear

--

* Bureaucracies have discretion 

--

* A policy is generally useless if it isn’t implemented

--

* Implementation battles are also where significant power and debate come in

# Top-Down Approach

**Design starts at the top — highest-level policy designers** 

--

**Assumes**
.pull-left[
* Clear goals
* Clear tools
* Single statute or other authority
]

.pull-right[
* Clear implementation chain
* Knowledge of capacity and commitment of implementers
]

# Bottom-Up Approach 

**Start from perspective of _street-level bureaucrats_** 

--

* Elmore: _backward mapping_ of the implementation system

--

* Recognizes that goals are ambiguous

--

* Does not require a single statute or “policy”

--

* Better accommodates a “network” of implementation actors

--

**Implementation best understood as a mix of top-down and bottom-up**
