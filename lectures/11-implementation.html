# Policy implementation: Top-down vs bottom-up

---

class: title title-1

# Top-Down Approach 

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; **A way of studying policy design and implementation that considers the goals of the highest-level policy designers and traces the design and implementation of the policy through the lowest-level implementers**  

-*Birkland* pg. 347

---

class: title title-1

# Top-Down Approach 

**Design starts at the top—highest-level policy designers** 

--

**Assumes** 

--

* Clear goals

--

* Clear tools

--

* Single statute or other authority

--

* Clear implementation chain

--

* Knowledge of capacity and commitment of implementers

???
**Are these assumptions realistic**?
---

class: title title-1

# Top-Down Approach 

**Issues** 

--

**Does not account for federalism** 
* Feds can set guidelines better than hard rules
* Local officials can engage in _strategic delay_ 

--

**Most policies are based in multiple statutes** 

---

class: title title-1

# Top-Down Approach 

**Issues** 

**But, the feds can ...**
* Impose roles on who implements
* Apply incentives and sanctions to promote a particular design

# Bottom-Up Approach 

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; **A way of studying policy design and implementation that considers the abilities and motivations of the lowest-level implementers, and tracks policy design from that level to the highest levels of government** 

-*Birkland* pg. 349 

---

class: title title-1

# Bottom-Up Approach 

**Start from perspective of _street-level bureaucrats_** 

--

**Assumes** 

--

* Policy goals are ambiguous 

--

* More than a single statute or “policy”

--

* A _network_ of implementation actors


???
**Are these assumptions realistic**? 

---

class: title title-1

# Bottom-Up Approach

**Issues** 

--

**Overemphasizes street-level bureaucrats’ discretion** 
* Top levels can impose sanctions
* Street-level may _want_ to follow the lead of the top-level designers

--

**Assumes that interest groups are always active participants** 

* Policies without publics—low mobilization
* Target groups often lack influence, power

---

class: title title-1

# Synthesis: Top-Down and Bottom-Up 

**Implementation is communication between policy makers and implementers**

--

**Requirements for successful implementation** 

--

* Clear messages from credible officials `\(\rightarrow\)` receptive implementers 

--

* Implementers are given sufficient resources 

--

* Support from affected groups 

--

* Discretion can lead to innovation and learning 

---

class: title title-1

# Who Implements Policy? 

**Implementation is a political _and_ technical process**  

--
* _The executive branch agencies_ 

--
* The president through executive orders 

--
* The legislative branch through oversight 

--
* The judicial branch through oversight 

--
* Other levels of government

--
* Private actors

--

**Basically everybody**

# Administrative Burden 

**Some degree of burden is necessary to prevent fraud** 

--

**Guidelines** 

* Citizens are better off when public programs are designed to be simple, accessible, and respectful of the citizens they encounter

--

* Burdens should be minimized to the greatest extent consistent with protecting important public values, such as cost and program integrity 

---

class: title title-1

# Administrative Burden 

**Some degree of burden is necessary to prevent fraud** 

**Guidelines** 

* Considerations of burden should be evidence based, identifying the multiple values involved and the likely effects of burdens on those values, and informed by logic and empirical evidence rather than by political rhetoric **or lies** 

---

class: title title-1

# Administrative Burden 

**Some degree of burden is necessary to prevent fraud** 

**Guidelines** 

* Because burdens can affect some groups more than others, we should be especially attentive to costs on those with limited resources or in programs that are specifically to help those with limited means
