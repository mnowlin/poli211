# Some General Concepts

**All policies have goals** 

--

**What is the difference between a policy _output_ and an _outcome_?**

--

* **Output**: The measurable things an agency or organization produces 

--

* **Outcome**: The substantive results of the implementation of a policy 

--

**Policy goals are related to _outcomes_**

# Policy Analysis 

--

&gt; **The practice by which policy analysts use various analytic tools, often derived from fields such as operations research, statistics, and economics, to understand the likely outcomes and benefits of particular policy ideas.** 

-*Birkland*, pg. 285 

---

class: title title-1

# Policy Analysis 

**Identify _causal models_ of policy** 

* How does policy (X) impact outcome (Y)? 

* _How would a carbon tax reduce GHG emissions?_

**Practice of policy analysis** 

* Quantitative data, statistics  

* Cost-Benefit Analysis 

---

class: title title-1

# Policy Analysis 

**Role of the policy analyst and analytical integrity** 

--

* **Objective Technician**: _Let the analysis speak for itself_  

--

* **Client's Advocate**: _Take advantage of ambiguity to advise clients' positions_  

--

* **Issue Advocate**: _Emphasize ambiguity and excluded values when analysis does not support advocacy_

# Decision-Making Models 

**Rational comprehensive** 

&gt; **A model of decision making in which it is assumed that decision makers have nearly all information about a problem, its causes, and its solutions at their disposal, whereupon a large number of alternatives can be weighed and the best one selected** 

-*Birkland* pg. 296

---

class: title title-1

# Decision-Making Models 

**Bounded rationality**

&gt; **A term that describes how decision-makers seek to act as rationally as possible within certain bounds or limits; these limits include time, limited information, and our limited human ability to recognize every feature and pattern of every problem** 

-*Birkland* pg. 297

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

--

## Measure the costs and benefits of each possible policy and then choose the policy that generates the _maximum net benefit_ to society as a whole

--

**Efficiency**: maximizing net benefits

--

**When markets fail they aren't providing the most efficient outcome** 

--

**CBA provides a systematic way to consider _trade-offs_ associated with policy alternatives and select the most efficient alternative**

# Sunstein: Facts not Values 

--

**_If you could show that a certain approach to, let’s say, motor vehicle safety would save 700 lives annually and cost $8,000, it wouldn’t matter what your values are, if you’re sane. That’s a pretty good thing to do_.**

--

**_Suppose you could show that an approach favored by environmental groups would cost $60 billion and only modestly contribute to public health. It would be very hard, even if you’re a very fervent progressive, to think that’s a good idea._**

---

class: title title-1

# Sunstein: Facts not Values 

**Immersion in the facts often makes value disagreements feel much less relevant**  

--

**People often use value cues as a basis for judgment and a mental shortcut. But, once people spend time to think about the costs and benefits, often value disagreement will dissipate** 

--

**_Do you agree with this statement?_** 

--

**It depends** 

---

class: title title-1

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

**The major steps** 

--

1. Specify the set of alternatives

--

1. Catalog the costs and benefits and select measurement indicators

--

1. Monetize all costs and benefits

--

1. Discount benefits and costs to obtain _net present values_

--

1. Compute the net present value of each alternative

--

1. Based on net present values determine the most efficient alternative

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

**How are costs measured?** 

--

**Opportunity costs** 

--

* What you give up by doing one thing instead of another

* Represents the _true_ cost of any activity 

---

class: title title-1 

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

**How are costs measured?** 

**Costs are borne by individuals including taxpayers, shareholders, and consumers** 

--

**Pollution control regulation example**
* Obtaining information from industry 
* Data on revenues and production costs to estimate lost profits

# The Value of A Statistical Life

**Calculation** 

* What would someone be willing to pay for a reduction in their individual risk of dying of 1 in 100,000, or 0.001%, over the next year?
