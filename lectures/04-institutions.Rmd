# Institutions and Democracy 

> If a _country_ is to be governed democratically, what would be required? At a minimum, it would need to possess certain political arrangements, practices, or institutions that would go a long way, even if not all the way, toward meeting ideal democratic criteria. 

.tr[
— Dahl, pg 83

# What is Democracy? 

**Criteria for a democratic process** 

* Effective participation 

* Equality in voting 

* Gaining enlightened understanding 

* Exercising final control over the agenda 

* Inclusion of adults 

???

Effective participation: all members must have _equal and effective opportunities_  to make their views known 

Equality in voting: all members must have an _equal and effective opportunity_ to vote and all votes must be counted as equal 

Gaining enlightened understanding: _equal and effective opportunities_  for learning about relevant alternative policies and their likely consequences 

Exercising final control over the agenda: members must have the exclusive opportunity to decide how and, if they choose, what matter will be placed on the agenda 

Inclusion of adults: all (or at least most) adult permanent residents should have the full rights of citizens that are implied by the first four criteria
