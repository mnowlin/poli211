# What is policy evaluation? 

---

class: title title-1

# Policy Evaluation 

</br>

> **The estimation, appraisal, or assessment of a policy, it's content, implementation, goal attainment, and other effects**  

-*Anderson* pg 290 

---

class: title title-1

# Policy Evaluation 

**Goals accomplished?** 

--

**Other effects (intended or unintended)?** 
* Policies almost always have some unintended consequences 

--

**Final "stage", but can occur at any point in the process** 
* Remember "stages" is useful but not entirely accurate 

---

class: title title-1

# Policy Impacts 

**Outputs vs Outcomes** 

--

**Policy outputs** 

* _Things actually done by agencies in pursuance of policy decisions and statements_

--

* Can usually be readily counted, totaled, and statistically analyzed

--

* Examples: miles of highway built, welfare benefits paid, traffic fines collect

---

class: title title-1

# Policy Impacts 

**Outputs vs Outcomes** 

**Policy outcomes (results)** 

* _The consequences for society, intended and unintended, that stem from deliberate governmental action or inaction_ 

* Example: do welfare benefits reduce poverty? 

--

**Policy Impacts: An amalgam of outputs and outcomes**

# Policy Impacts 

**Dimensions of policy impact**

--

**Policies have intended effects on target populations** 
* Intended effects and target populations must be defined 
* Intended vs. unintended consequences 

--

**May affect situations or groups other than those at which they are directed**
* Third-party effects, spillover effects, externalities. May be positive or negative

---

class: title title-1

# Policy Impacts 

**Dimensions of policy impact**

**Policies impact future and current conditions** 
* Future effects may be diffuse or uncertain

--

**Policies have costs as well as benefits** 

--
* _Direct costs_: government + private sector 

--
* _Indirect costs_: reduced production, higher prices 

--
* _Opportunity costs_: resources for one purpose can't be used for another purpose 

---

class: title title-1

# Policy Impacts 

**Dimensions of policy impact**

**Effects can be material (tangible) or symbolic (intangible)** 

* Policies intended to be material may, in practice, merely be symbolic

* Symbolic outputs tap into popular beliefs, attitudes and aspirations, but produce no real change
