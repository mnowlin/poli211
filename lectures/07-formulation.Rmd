# Policy proposals can be developed separately from problems

# Multiple Streams 

**The Multiple Streams Approach states that the policymaking process consists of three separate streams:**

--

* **Problem stream**: contains information about problems (e.g., indicators, focusing events)

--

* **Policy stream**: policy ideas and alternatives  

--

* **Politics stream**: includes public opinion, elections, interest group activity 

---

class: title title-1

# Multiple Streams 

**Problems reach the policymaking agenda when the three streams converge when a _policy window_ is open.** 

--

* **Policy window**: opportunities for advocates to push for attention to their issues and/or favored policy alternatives 

--

* **Policy entrepreneurs**: advocates willing to invest resources in the hopes of future benefits  
  * Work to combine streams when a policy window is open
