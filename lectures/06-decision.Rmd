--

Seeks to answer the question: _what should we do_? 

--

Its use has grown over time, as has the complexity of the analysis

# Models of Decision-Making 

**Rational comprehensive**:
* Analysis of goals and tools is separate
* Goals isolated before tools are selected
* Good policy is the technically best policy
* All important factors considered
* Heavy reliance on theory

# Models of Decision-Making 

**Bounded rationality**:  
* Goals and tools are “closely intertwined”
* Means and ends (tools and goals) are not distinct
* Good policy is one where consensus is reached on adoption
* Analysis is limited 
* Successive comparisons “reduces or eliminates reliance on theory.”

# Incrementalism

**Based in notions of “bounded rationality”**
* People cannot process all information
* We do the best we can with the information we can process

--

**Decisions are made in increments, which allow for**
* “Successive limited comparisons”—that is, tests and adjustments of policy
* Not having to separate means from ends, which could slow decisions

# Incrementalism

**But, some decisions must be big leaps**  
* Going to the moon
* Starting wars
* Addressing the Great Depression
