# Policy implementation: Top-down vs bottom-up

---

class: title title-1

# Top-Down Approach 

<br>

> **A way of studying policy design and implementation that considers the goals of the highest-level policy designers and traces the design and implementation of the policy through the lowest-level implementers**  

-*Birkland* pg. 347

---

class: title title-1

# Top-Down Approach 

**Design starts at the top—highest-level policy designers** 

--

**Assumes** 

--

* Clear goals

--

* Clear tools

--

* Single statute or other authority

--

* Clear implementation chain

--

* Knowledge of capacity and commitment of implementers

???
**Are these assumptions realistic**?
---

class: title title-1

# Top-Down Approach 

**Issues** 

--

**Does not account for federalism** 
* Feds can set guidelines better than hard rules
* Local officials can engage in _strategic delay_ 

--

**Most policies are based in multiple statutes** 

---

class: title title-1

# Top-Down Approach 

**Issues** 

**But, the feds can ...**
* Impose roles on who implements
* Apply incentives and sanctions to promote a particular design

# Bottom-Up Approach 

<br>

> **A way of studying policy design and implementation that considers the abilities and motivations of the lowest-level implementers, and tracks policy design from that level to the highest levels of government** 

-*Birkland* pg. 349 

---

class: title title-1

# Bottom-Up Approach 

**Start from perspective of _street-level bureaucrats_** 

--

**Assumes** 

--

* Policy goals are ambiguous 

--

* More than a single statute or “policy”

--

* A _network_ of implementation actors


???
**Are these assumptions realistic**? 

---

class: title title-1

# Bottom-Up Approach

**Issues** 

--

**Overemphasizes street-level bureaucrats’ discretion** 
* Top levels can impose sanctions
* Street-level may _want_ to follow the lead of the top-level designers

--

**Assumes that interest groups are always active participants** 

* Policies without publics—low mobilization
* Target groups often lack influence, power

---

class: title title-1

# Synthesis: Top-Down and Bottom-Up 

**Implementation is communication between policy makers and implementers**

--

**Requirements for successful implementation** 

--

* Clear messages from credible officials $\rightarrow$ receptive implementers 

--

* Implementers are given sufficient resources 

--

* Support from affected groups 

--

* Discretion can lead to innovation and learning 

---

# Who Implements Policy? 

**Implementation is a political _and_ technical process**  

--
* _The executive branch agencies_ 

--
* The president through executive orders 

--
* The legislative branch through oversight 

--
* The judicial branch through oversight 

--
* Other levels of government

--
* Private actors

--

**Basically everybody**
