# What is Democracy? 

_A system of government with regular, free and fair elections, in which all adult citizens have the right to vote and possess basic civil liberties such as freedom of speech and association_

# What is Democracy? 


**One _elementary principle_ of democracy** 

_That all members [of a polity] are to be treated (under the constitution) as if they were equally qualified to participate in the process of making decisions about the policies [the polity] will pursue_


.footnote[-_Dahl_, pg. 37]

# What is Democracy? 

**Criteria for a democratic process** 

--

* Effective participation 

--

* Equality in voting 

--

* Gaining enlightened understanding 

--

* Exercising final control over the agenda 

--

* Inclusion of adults 

???

Effective participation: all members must have _equal and effective opportunities_  to make their views known 

Equality in voting: all members must have an _equal and effective opportunity_ to vote and all votes must be counted as equal 

Gaining enlightened understanding: _equal and effective opportunities_  for learning about relevant alternative policies and their likely consequences 

Exercising final control over the agenda: members must have the exclusive opportunity to decide how and, if they choose, what matter will be placed on the agenda 

Inclusion of adults: all (or at least most) adult permanent residents should have the full rights of citizens that are implied by the first four criteria
