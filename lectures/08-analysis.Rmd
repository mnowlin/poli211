# Some General Concepts

**All policies have goals**

--

* **Output**: The measurable things an agency or organization produces 

--

* **Outcome**: The substantive results of the implementation of a policy 

--

**Policy goals are related to _outcomes_**

-*Birkland*, pg. 285

class: title title-1

# Policy Analysis

# Decision-Making Models 

**Rational comprehensive** 

> **A model of decision making in which it is assumed that decision makers have nearly all information about a problem, its causes, and its solutions at their disposal, whereupon a large number of alternatives can be weighed and the best one selected** 

-*Birkland* pg. 296

---

class: title title-1

# Decision-Making Models 

**Bounded rationality**

> **A term that describes how decision-makers seek to act as rationally as possible within certain bounds or limits; these limits include time, limited information, and our limited human ability to recognize every feature and pattern of every problem** 

-*Birkland* pg. 297

# Incrementalism 

**Decisions are made in increments, which allow for**:


--


* “Successive limited comparisons”—that is, tests and adjustments of policy

--

* Not having to separate means from ends, which could slow decisions

# Market Failures


~~**Perfect competition**~~

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

--

## Measure the costs and benefits of each possible policy and then choose the policy that generates the _maximum net benefit_ to society as a whole

--

**Efficiency**: maximizing net benefits

--

**When markets fail they aren't providing the most efficient outcome** 

--

**CBA provides a systematic way to consider _trade-offs_ associated with policy alternatives and select the most efficient alternative**

# Sunstein: Facts not Values 

--

**_If you could show that a certain approach to, let’s say, motor vehicle safety would save 700 lives annually and cost $8,000, it wouldn’t matter what your values are, if you’re sane. That’s a pretty good thing to do_.**

--

**_Suppose you could show that an approach favored by environmental groups would cost $60 billion and only modestly contribute to public health. It would be very hard, even if you’re a very fervent progressive, to think that’s a good idea._**

---

class: title title-1

# Sunstein: Facts not Values 

**Immersion in the facts often makes value disagreements feel much less relevant**  

--

**People often use value cues as a basis for judgment and a mental shortcut. But, once people spend time to think about the costs and benefits, often value disagreement will dissipate** 

--

**_Do you agree with this statement?_** 

--

**It depends** 

---

class: title title-1

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

**The major steps** 

--

1. Specify the set of alternatives

--

1. Catalog the costs and benefits and select measurement indicators

--

1. Monetize all costs and benefits

--

1. Discount benefits and costs to obtain _net present values_

--

1. Compute the net present value of each alternative

--

1. Based on net present values determine the most efficient alternative
