\noindent As highlighted in the syllabus, the research presentation is an opportunity to apply what you have learned in this course by analyzing an important policy issue or problem. Sources should be listed at the bottom of each slide and the presentation should include the following information:

### I. Title (5 points)
Titles are important so take some time to come up with a good title for your presentation.

### II. Overview of Presentation (5 points)
Take the opportunity to tell the audience what you plan to cover and preview some of your key findings and big themes

### III. Overview of the Problem (20 points)
Give the audience a sense of the nature of the problem. Why should the public or public officials be concerned about the issue? Why it is a "problem" and not a "condition"? Include some information about indicators of the problem. Good sources could include peer-reviewed journal articles, government reports, research institute reports, newspaper articles, or other credible publications. Be sure to properly cite the sources of information.

### IV Policy Actors (10 points)
Talk some about important policy actors involved in the issue. Are they official or unofficial? 

### V. Current Policies (10 points)
Please provide an overview of current policies in place with regard to the issue. Why are they not sufficient to address the issue? 

### VI. Policy Alternatives (20 points)
Highlight three policy alternatives or policy tools aimed at addressing the issue. What are some potential strengths and weaknesses of each approach? The approaches can be those recommended by someone else (be sure and cite) or ones that you create.  

### VII. Policy Recommendation (20 points)
Based on your examination of the strengths and weaknesses of each policy alternative, make a recommendation regarding which policy alternative should be adopted. Justify your recommendation.  

### VIII. Summary Slide (10 points)
Summarize your key findings here.

### Frequently asked questions 


\vspace{.1in}
\noindent _How do I start_? The first step is to select a policy problem or issue to research. You want to make sure you can collect the information that you will need to include in the presentation. Once you complete your research, you will need to make a PowerPoint presentation. Once the presentation is complete, it is best to save the presentation as a PDF file. The next step is to upload the presentation into VoiceThread. You can access VoiceThread on the main page for this course. You will then use VoiceThread to narrate each slide. Once you have completed the project, be sure to send me the link so I can view the presentation. Let me know if you have questions.

\noindent _What are some examples of problems or issues that I could research_? Any issue **other than those used in this course (democracy, healthcare inequality, police reform, and immigration)** are fair game. You can choose an issue that is of national, state, or local concern. Examples include climate change, pollution, public health, healthcare, criminal justice, poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, among many others. Note that these examples are very broad and you will likely need to narrow for your research. **You need to email me your proposed topic for approval by July 23**.
