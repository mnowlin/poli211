## Paper Guidelines 

Each issue paper will focus on a different aspect of the one problem or policy issue you choose. **I recommend, but won't require you to pick a national issue**. You should include at least four _academic_ sources (not including course readings) for each paper. Appropriate sources include (for example, but not limited to), peer-reviewed journal articles, books, government reports, research institute ("think tank") reports, and mainstream newspaper articles. 

### Issue Paper 1: Define the Problem 

In issue paper 1, you should provide a brief overview of your policy issue to introduce the reader to the issue. It can include answers to such questions as, why is it an important issue? What makes it a societal problem? Why should policy makers be concerned about the issue? Define some of the key terms with regard to the issue. Make clear if you are examining an issue on the local, state, or **federal** level. **Should be 3-4 pages double-spaced and is due: Feb 3** 

### Issue Paper 2: Institutions, Subsystems, and Agenda-Setting

In issue paper 2, describe the institutions involved in policymaking with regard to your policy problem. What congressional committees, executive branch agencies, and interest groups are involved in your issue? Finally, what are some ways for your issue to reach the policymaking agenda. **Should be 3-4 pages double-spaced and is due: Feb 24**

### Issue Paper 3: Current Policies 

In issue paper 3, you should discuss what policy or policies are currently in place to address your issue. Is there legislation? Who implements it? Are there regulations? What are some of the current policy tools that are being used with regard to the issue?  **Should be 3-4 pages double-spaced and is due: March 24**

### Issue Paper 4: Policy Alternatives

In issue paper 4, you should briefly describe three policy alternatives that could be implemented to address your policy issue. In your description, be sure and describe the pros and cons of each approach. Then, make a recommendation about which policy alternative a decision-maker should select and why.  **Should be 3-4 pages double-spaced and is due: April 21**
